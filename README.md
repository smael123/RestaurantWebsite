# RestaurantWebsite
A restaurant website built using ASP.NET MVC.

I started this project in order to learn about ASP.NET MVC.

Known Issues:
<ul>
<li>Food has to exist in order to add an extra to it.</li>
<li>Special has to exist in order to add a food to it.</li>
</ul>
Need To Implement:

<ul><li>Deletion options</li>
<li>Form Validation</li>
<li>Customer Menu</li>
  <li><s>Images for foods and specials</s></li>
<li>Manager only features (manager is the only one who should edit and create foods and specials)</li></ul>
